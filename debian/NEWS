iptables-persistent (1.0.20) unstable; urgency=medium

  iptables-persistent.service, ip6tables-persistent.service and
  ipset-persistent.service are now aliases instead of alternatives, using
  native functionality to provide alternative names. Users wishing to use such
  names can use 'systemctl enable netfilter-persistent.service' to enable them,
  and can override them using the standard systemd configuration mechanisms.
  Other packages wishing to provide the same service names simply have to
  declare the same aliases in their units, and users can enable the one they
  prefer.
